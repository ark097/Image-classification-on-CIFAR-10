CIFAR-10 Image Classification Project

This project focuses on building an image classification model for the CIFAR-10 dataset. CIFAR-10 is a well-known dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images across ten classes, with 6,000 images per class. The objective is to develop a robust deep learning model that accurately classifies these images into their respective categories.

Project Description:

The CIFAR-10 dataset is widely used in the field of computer vision and serves as an excellent benchmark for image classification tasks. This project aims to implement various deep learning models to achieve high accuracy in classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.

Dependencies:

Python 3.x
TensorFlow or PyTorch (based on the chosen model)
NumPy
Matplotlib
